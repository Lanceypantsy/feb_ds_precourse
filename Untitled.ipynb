    "### Transposing vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, it is possible to view vectors as \\\\( \\by{1}{n}\\\\), or in other words, a row vector. There are three possible ways to think about vectors in the context of a matrix (or a DataFrame): as row vectors, as column vectors, or as neither. The Galvanize DSI program will take the position that as a default, vectors are __*row vectors*__. Then \\\\(\\mathbf{v}^T\\\\) is a __*column vector*__ . However, this is primarily a notational convenience and the other ways of thinking are equally valid.\n",
